# Comparing Support Vector Classifier and Neural Network on the Iris Dataset

This is one of author's porfolio projects. A support vector classifier and a neural netwrok are used in classifying  Iris flower species here. It demostrates exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, machine learning algorithms, and model evaluation.
